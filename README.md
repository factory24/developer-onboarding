Developer On-Boarding Process: Here we'll consider several things

 - Metrics: engagement level on your community chat group(s), number of followers on social media, member interests in particular topics or languages, interest in certain products or technology etc

 - Build Leaders: in roles such as team leads, group leads, admins, ambassadors or higher roles such as developer advocates, developer community managers etc

 - Feedback Loops: take in feedback as they help your community or product iterate faster, communities dwell a lot of member-feedback as they are their sole priority for starting one at the first place, issue tracking, feature requests or Q&A are some example method of getting feedback

Rewards or Incentives: a lot of developers also join certain communities as a result of the incentives and rewards gotten from the community like  swag packs, t-shirts, free skill acquisition, scholarships etc as benefitsThis repo is a simple guide for the Factory24 developer onboarding process. Afrolynk is keen on on-boarding developers that are a perfect fit for our organization.
